# amfoss-tasks
tasks related to amFOSS.

Hello there, whoever is reading this! you might be asking what is this about? well, the instrutions I was given was: 

Make a private GitHub repository titled amfoss-tasks. 
Create a README.md file in the root of the repository to introduce yourself and answer the following questions:
Why should we choose you?
What are your goals for the next six months? How will you accomplish them?
How will you contribute back to the club?
	Do include any thoughts or feedback you have on the praveshan process as well.

 so that leads us to now. I'll try answering to the best of my capabilities.
 1. Why should we choose you? - beacuse I work hard? honestly, I could a give a half baked answer but we all know it isn't geniune. hell, I could have just asked ChatGPT to do it for me. so the answer? well, I hope you see me as I grow and hope you think I'm a talent worth nurturing

 2. What are your goals for the next six months? How will you accomplish them? - to be able to do all the tasks I was assigned in amFOSS and bi0s at the beginning of my freshmen year with ease. maybe it's better to have a more concrete goal but having a soft one makes it easier for me to adapt as I go along. i learned things like Wireshark via tasks bi0s gave me that I genuinely thought were things I would only do on my 4th year or once I get a job. so I think it's better to reserve an exact answer since the future is always changing.

 3. teaching my juniors. I love teaching, even if I'm horrible at it. especially maths. I make a lot of connections which I take for granted and it's only when my sister asks me a doubt do I realise something I consider intuitive is not necassarily as simple as for someone else. of course, I have friends who I consider extremly gifted who'll have knowledge i can't understand one bit, thanks to my monkey brain. but it's beacause of both these experiences that I know sometimes, learning something is just waiting for someone to connect two things, completly different in your mind and knot them beautufully, giving a depth to both of them. I want to do that, just once. 

Do include any thoughts or feedback you have on the praveshan process as well - none particularly polarising so far, I'll update it here if there are any changes

ah, alse there are two tasks here that should be called task-05(imgaginedragons) and task-06(myvr) that aren't properly named. I currently dont have the the time to rename them since I have to go for amma's duties shortly. sorry for any inconvenience caused my incompetence.
