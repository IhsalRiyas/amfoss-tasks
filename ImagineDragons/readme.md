if I had to choose one task that consumed the most time out of me, it will probably be this or the discord bot. well, probably the discord bot if I do end up completing it. currently, Its Oct 1, 1:33 AM(yes,
I'm still countng). pain. pure pain. I honestly don't know what the point of this whole thing is. if I were to write what each part of the code did, I'll probably be here for days and last I checked , I had 
less than one so we have to improvise.

so I'll let me what my code did in caveman language:
me write html. give img src. picture seen in live server, caveman very happy. then caveman make link button. also cavemen making shop for imagining dragons. caveman never heard of such dragons but he always
follows word of shaman. shop was made very pretty. caveman made sure to use sharp pencils like flexbox, css files to make the shop like shaman say.

then caveman made second page. at first, very confused as he would have to do erase his first page from sand. but then shaman told him to use the INTERNET, a tool only shamans had but now also caveman because
shaman trust caveman. caveman then do code in "html". very nice.

thats it for caveman language. I wanted to drag it more but I thought the joke wasn't worth dragging on any more. anyways, if there are any issues in the code, ig i'll explain it in the interview phase.

oh, also if someone asks, the sizes are different in size because I wanted the customers to get an authetic impression of what they would buy, rather than an ideal case of one. it definetely wasn't because
I couldn't fix it even if my life depended on it. even chatgpt couldn't help me. Hypothetically speaking, of course.
