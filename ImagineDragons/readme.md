if I had to choose one task that consumed the most time out of me, it will probably be this or the discord bot. well, probably the discord bot if I do end up completing it. the task was quite challenging.

the basics of the task was html files, css files and then learning about the different functions like flexbot. 

oh, also if someone asks, the sizes are different in size because I wanted the customers to get an authetic impression of what they would buy, rather than an ideal case of one. it definetely wasn't because
I couldn't fix it.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
