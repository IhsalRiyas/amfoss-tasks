 I did some of the other languages on my own , watching too many supersimpledev and freecodecamp videos but at one point, I just started using chatgpt.
 I then asked hari govind if its fine to chatgpt and he said that's fine as long as I understand the code. 

that made the task so much easier. most of it consist of me asking chatgpt the code, then asking the explanantion and maybe watching a video or two in case I couldn't quite catch the concept.
