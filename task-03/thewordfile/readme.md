this was a pain. like genuinely. like I understand asking someone to learn c,c++, java , javascript and python for a task. that is somewhat understandable, even if the same college takes literal semesters to
learn one of these language. Thats all fine. my problem were the others. Elixirs, Rust, Haskell? ngl, they all sound like some sort of food and I want it. can you tell I'm slowly loosing my mind? I'm trying to
write this godamm readme file at Oct 1, 1:15 AM( yes, the same day) while 8 people are watching a Turkish horror movie besides me.

anyways, that was a tangent. let's get back to the main task. I did some of the other languages on my own , watching too many supersimpledev and freecodecamp videos but at one point, I just started using chatgpt.
like cmon, you seriously can't expect me to learn all of this. that's my excuse anyways. I then asked hari govind if its fine to chatgpt and he said that's fine as long as I understand the code. 

that made the task so much easier. most of it consist of me asking chatgpt the code, then asking the explanantion and maybe watching a video or two in case I couldn't quite catch the concept. easy clap.
also , i felt like this readme was a bit boring, you probably got bored or either annoyed at me, so here's a cookie:
