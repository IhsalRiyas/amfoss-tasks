this contains a json file, html as well as javascript .had a hard time in the beginning but it was more resonable than the discord bot task. 
he reason one of the images is called 162 rather than 16 was because it was my second attempt at trying to upload the file. I think there was a ratio issue or the file was jpeg,
I forget. anyways, that's why it's like that essentially.

 if you try to use my extension, it will show you the temperature in Kelvin. while converting it to Celcius is easy, I kept it as kelvin since the task didn't mention the temperature scale we should use.
