here are the common commands I used as far as I remember.

1. cd : change directory. essentially, the Windows equivalent to opening a file
2. ls : so remember cd? so while you have opened the file, you can't see its contents . ls helps with that. it essentially tells you all elements that are within that folder.
3. git clone: so sometimes you want to copy a repository from github, so a command method to get all its contents is to clone the files. essentially copy pasted the contents to the directory you are
currently on 

4.git checkout: so there are like multiple braches in a git repository, generally speaking( well, for most big projects anyways). you use this command to change your branch since it is possible they contain
files the main branch don't

5.git add: the starting process once you have edited the files in your cloned repository and you add these changes officially essentially.just type in the name of the file you want updated and eventually 
pushed.
6.git commit -m : essentially, the git version of comments. or one variety of it at least. I mainly use this to curse amfoss tho. I think? don't really know, I think my commit for this for something like
"this was a pain, thank you amfoss"? or was that hugo? eh, can't bother checking.

7.git push origin main: congralutions, you have know officially 'pushed' or edited your github contents successfully. the whole origin main means you pushed it into your main branch.
